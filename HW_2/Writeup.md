### What Data is being provided and consumed?
Information about Gi's is being provided and consumed. The price, maker, description etc. and customers can buy those Gi's if they want.

### What real world goal drives this need?
There are many people who have small gyms and associations who make Gi's but there is no central platform that caters to both big and small providers so that everyone has a chance to sell their wares equally.

### What aspect of this is hard?
A friend of mine who was selling Gi's at his gym was told that he couldn't since the gym had their own brand that they wanted to sell. He was told he might get thrown out of the gym after training there almost 10 years!
